## üõ†Ô∏è Regression of Used Car Prices - Kaggle Playground Series (Season 4, Episode 9) üîÆ

### **Objective** üéØ

The objective of this competition is to predict the price of used cars based on various attributes. The dataset provided for this competition includes various features related to used cars, such as the car's model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and engine power. The target variable for this competition is the price of the used car.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Dataset üì¶

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Used Car Price Prediction Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

**Explore the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e9/data), develop your machine learning models, and submit your predictions through the Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e9/overview) platform before the deadline.**

## Files üìÑ

- **train.csv**: Training dataset containing the different variables where; price is the continuous target.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset for which your objective is to predict the value of price for each row
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file demonstrating the correct format for predictions.

## **Evaluation** üìä

### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

In this project, we evaluate the performance of our predictive model using the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** metric. RMSE is a widely used measure of the differences between predicted values and the actual observed values. It provides insight into the accuracy of our model by quantifying how closely our predictions match the original data.

### Formula

The RMSE is calculated using the following formula:

The root mean squared error (RMSE) is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2} \]

Where:
- ***N*** is the total number of instances.
- ***yi*** represents the actual value for the ***i*** instance.
- ***yÀÜi*** represents the predicted value for the ***i*** instance.

### Interpretation

- **Low RMSE**: A lower RMSE value indicates that the predicted values are close to the actual values, signifying better model performance.
- **High RMSE**: A higher RMSE value suggests a larger discrepancy between predicted and actual values, indicating that the model may not be accurately capturing the underlying data patterns.

### Importance of RMSE:- 

RMSE is particularly important because:
- It penalizes large errors more than smaller ones, making it sensitive to outliers.
- It is easy to interpret, as it provides the error in the same units as the original data.
- It is a useful measure when comparing the accuracy of different models or algorithms.
